## Credits
This repository was originally developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN) as a teaching tool in the Digitising Cultural Heritage Materials course at the [University of BorÃ¥s](https://www.hb.se/), where he currently works as a Senior Lecturer in Library and Information Science. Continued development of the template has in part been made possible by [Huminfra](https://www.huminfra.se), the Swedish national infrastructure project for Digital Humanities.

Special thanks to [vincerubinetti](https://github.com/vincerubinetti), whose GitHub Action (mentioned in [this forum comment](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/22183#discussioncomment-4585507)) formed the basis of the template cleanup procedure mentioned above, and to [Andre601](https://github.com/Andre601), for helping me figure out how to update the `.yml` file to get it to work.
