## Credits
The template for this repository was originally developed by [Wout Dillen](https://github.com/WoutDLN) as a teaching tool in the Digitising Cultural Heritage Materials course at the [University of BorÃ¥s](https://www.hb.se/), where he currently works as a Senior Lecturer in Library and Information Science. Continued development of the template has in part been made possible by [Huminfra](https://www.huminfra.se), the Swedish national infrastructure project for Digital Humanities.
